\begin{document}
consider two equation as follows

x-7y+5 = 0    (1)

3x+y = 0      (2)

from 2 we get

y = -3x

substituting the value of 'y' in (1)

x-7(-3x)+5=0

22x = -5

x = -5/22(-0.22727) , y = 15/22 (0.6818)  

therefore we get point of intersection 

now the equation of line parallel to y - axis through the point of intersection 

slope = 1/0 (parallel to y axis )

y - 15/22 = 1/0 (x + 5/22)

x = -5 / 22 ( the equation of line parallel to y axis )
